   		"boatrace": ["The Frogs and the Ox\nAn Ox came down to a reedy pool to drink. As he splashed heavily into the water, he crushed a young Frog into the mud.\nThe old Frog soon missed the little one and asked his brothers and sisters what had become of him.\n'A great big monster,' said one of them, 'stepped on little brother with one of his huge feet!'\n'Big, was he!' said the old Frog, puffing herself up. 'Was he as big as this?'\n'Oh, much bigger!' they cried.\nThe Frog puffed up still more.\n'He could not have been bigger than this,' she said. But the little Frogs all declared that the monster was much, much bigger and the old Frog kept puffing herself out more and more until, all at once, she burst.\nDo not attempt the impossible.", "The Lion and the Mouse\nA Lion lay asleep in the forest, his great head resting on his paws. A timid little Mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright and haste to get away, ran across the nose of the Lion. Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her.\n'Spare me!' begged the poor Mouse. 'Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you.'\nThe Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go.\nSome days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in the toils of a net. Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion was free.\n'You laughed when I said I would repay you,' said the Mouse. 'Now you see that even a Mouse can help a Lion.'", "The Gnat and the Bull\nA Gnat flew over the meadow with much buzzing for so small a creature and settled on the tip of one of the horns of a Bull. After he had rested a short time, he made ready to fly away. But before he left he begged the pardon of the Bull for having used his horn for a resting place.\n'You must be very glad to have me go now,' he said.\n'It is all the same to me,' replied the Bull. 'I did not even know you were there.'\nWe are often of greater importance in our own eyes than in the eyes of our neighbor. The smaller the mind the greater the conceit.", "The Plane Tree\nTwo Travellers, walking in the noonday sun, sought the shade of a widespreading tree to rest. As they lay looking up among the pleasant leaves, they saw that it was a Plane Tree.\n'How useless is the Plane!' said one of them. 'It bears no fruit whatever, and only serves to litter the ground with leaves.'\n'Ungrateful creatures!' said a voice from the Plane Tree. 'You lie here in my cooling shade, and yet you say I am useless! Thus ungratefully, O Jupiter, do men receive their blessings!'\nOur best blessings are often the least appreciated.", "The Crow and the Pitcher\nIn a spell of dry weather, when the Birds could find very little to drink, a thirsty Crow found a pitcher with a little water in it. But the pitcher was high and had a narrow neck, and no matter how he tried, the Crow could not reach the water. The poor thing felt as if he must die of thirst.\nThen an idea came to him. Picking up some small pebbles, he dropped them into the pitcher one by one. With each pebble the water rose a little higher until at last it was near enough so he could drink.\nIn a pinch a good use of our wits may help us out.", "The Wild Boar and the Fox\nA Wild Boar was sharpening his tusks busily against the stump of a tree, when a Fox happened by. Now the Fox was always looking for a chance to make fun of his neighbors. So he made a great show of looking anxiously about, as if in fear of some hidden enemy. But the Boar kept right on with his work.\n'Why are you doing that?' asked the Fox at last with a grin. 'There is not any danger that I can see.'\n'True enough,' replied the Boar, 'but when danger does come there will not be time for such work as this. My weapons will have to be ready for use then, or I shall suffer for it.'\nPreparedness for war is the best guarantee of peace.", "The Stag and His Reflection\nA Stag, drinking from a crystal spring, saw himself mirrored in the clear water. He greatly admired the graceful arch of his antlers, but he was very much ashamed of his spindling legs.\n'How can it be,' he sighed, 'that I should be cursed with such legs when I have so magnificent a crown.'\nAt that moment he scented a panther and in an instant was bounding away through the forest. But as he ran his wide-spreading antlers caught in the branches of the trees, and soon the Panther overtook him. Then the Stag perceived that the legs of which he was so ashamed would have saved him had it not been for the useless ornaments on his head.\nWe often make much of the ornamental and despise the useful.", "The Wolf in Sheep’s Clothing\nA certain Wolf could not get enough to eat because of the watchfulness of the Shepherds. But one night he found a sheep skin that had been cast aside and forgotten. The next day, dressed in the skin, the Wolf strolled into the pasture with the Sheep. Soon a little Lamb was following him about and was quickly led away to slaughter.\nThat evening the Wolf entered the fold with the flock. But it happened that the Shepherd took a fancy for mutton broth that very evening, and, picking up a knife, went to the fold. There the first he laid hands on and killed was the Wolf.\nThe evil doer often comes to harm through his own deceit.", "The Ant and the Dove\nA Dove saw an Ant fall into a brook. The Ant struggled in vain to reach the bank, and in pity, the Dove dropped a blade of straw close beside it. Clinging to the straw like a shipwrecked sailor to a broken spar, the Ant floated safely to shore.\nSoon after, the Ant saw a man getting ready to kill the Dove with a stone. But just as he cast the stone, the Ant stung him in the heel, so that the pain made him miss his aim, and the startled Dove flew to safety in a distant wood.\nA kindness is never wasted.", "The Fisherman and the Little Fish\nA poor Fisherman, who lived on the fish he caught, had bad luck one day and caught nothing but a very small fry. The Fisherman was about to put it in his basket when the little Fish said:\n'Please spare me, Mr. Fisherman! I am so small it is not worth while to carry me home. When I am bigger, I shall make you a much better meal.'\nBut the Fisherman quickly put the fish into his basket.\n'How foolish I should be,' he said, 'to throw you back. However small you may be, you are better than nothing at all.'\nA small gain is worth more than a large promise.", "The Young Crab and His Mother\n'Why in the world do you walk sideways like that?' said a Mother Crab to her son. 'You should always walk straight forward with your toes turned out.'\n'Show me how to walk, mother dear,' answered the little Crab obediently, 'I want to learn.'\nSo the old Crab tried and tried to walk straight forward. But she could walk sideways only, like her son. And when she wanted to turn her toes out she tripped and fell on her nose.\nDo not tell others how to act unless you can set a good example.", "The Boy and Filberts\nA Boy was given permission to put his hand into a pitcher to get some filberts. But he took such a great fistful that he could not draw his hand out again. There he stood, unwilling to give up a single filbert and yet unable to get them all out at once. Vexed and disappointed he began to cry.\n'My boy,' said his mother, 'be satisfied with half the nuts you have taken and you will easily get your hand out. Then perhaps you may have some more filberts some other time.'\nDo not attempt too much at once.", "The Kid and the Wolf\n'A frisky young Kid had been left by the herdsman on the thatched roof of a sheep shelter to keep him out of the way of harm. The Kid was browsing near the edge of the roof, when he spied a Wolf and began to jeer at him, making faces and abusing him to his content of his heart.\n'I hear you,' said the Wolf, 'and I have not the least grudge against you for what you say or do. When you are up there it is the roof that is talking, not you.'\nDo not say anything at any time that you would not say at all times.", "The Sheep and the Pig\nOne day as the Lion walked proudly down a forest aisle, and the animals respectfully made way for him, a Donkey brayed a scornful remark as he passed.\nThe Lion felt a flash of anger. But when he turned his head and saw who had spoken, he walked quietly on. He would not honor the fool with even so much as a stroke of his claws.\nDo not resent the remarks of a fool. Ignore them.", "The Wolf and His Shadow\nA Wolf left his lair one evening in fine spirits and an excellent appetite. As he ran, the setting sun cast his shadow far out on the ground, and it looked as if the wolf were a hundred times bigger than he really was.\n'Why,' exclaimed the Wolf proudly, 'see how big I am! Fancy me running away from a puny Lion! I will show him who is fit to be king, he or I.'\nJust then an immense shadow blotted him out entirely, and the next instant a Lion struck him down with a single blow.\nDo not let your fancy make you forget realities.", "The Boys and Frogs\nSome Boys were playing one day at the edge of a pond in which lived a family of Frogs. The Boys amused themselves by throwing stones into the pond so as to make them skip on top of the water.\nThe stones were flying thick and fast and the Boys were enjoying themselves very much. But the poor Frogs in the pond were trembling with fear.\nAt last one of the Frogs, the oldest and bravest, put his head out of the water, and said, 'Oh, please, dear children, stop your cruel play! Though it may be fun for you, it means death to us!'\nAlways stop to think whether your fun may not be the cause of unhappiness of another.", "The Donkey Carrying the Image\nA sacred Image was being carried to the temple. It was mounted on a Donkey adorned with garlands and gorgeous trappings, and a grand procession of priests and pages followed it through the streets. As the Donkey walked along, the people bowed their heads reverently or fell on their knees, and the Donkey thought the honor was being paid to himself.\nWith his head full of this foolish idea, he became so puffed up with pride and vanity that he halted and started to bray loudly. But in the midst of his song, his driver guessed what the Donkey had got into his head, and began to beat him unmercifully with a stick.\n'Go along with you, you stupid Donkey,' he cried. 'The honor is not meant for you but for the image you are carrying.'\nDo not try to take the credit to yourself that is due to others.", "A Raven and a Swan\nA Raven, which you know is black as coal, was envious of the Swan, because her feathers were as white as the purest snow. The foolish bird got the idea that if he lived like the Swan, swimming and diving all day long and eating the weeds and plants that grow in the water, his feathers would turn white like that of the Swan.\nSo he left his home in the woods and fields and flew down to live on the lakes and in the marshes. But though he washed and washed all day long, almost drowning himself at it, his feathers remained as black as ever. And as the water weeds he ate did not agree with him, he got thinner and thinner, and at last he died.\nA change of habits will not alter nature.", "The Leap at Rhodes\nA certain man who visited foreign lands could talk of little when he returned to his home except the wonderful adventures he had met with and the great deeds he had done abroad.\nOne of the feats he told about was a leap he had made in a city Called Rhodes. That leap was so great, he said, that no other man could leap anywhere near the distance. A great many persons in Rhodes had seen him do it and would prove that what he told was true.\n'No need of witnesses,' said one of the hearers. 'Suppose this city is Rhodes. Now show us how far you can jump.'\nDeeds count, not boasting words.", "The Cock and the Jewel\nA Cock was busily scratching and scraping about to find something to eat for himself and his family, when he happened to turn up a precious jewel that had been lost by its owner.\n'Aha!' said the Cock. 'No doubt you are very costly and he who lost you would give a great deal to find you. But as for me, I would choose a single grain of barleycorn before all the jewels in the world.'\nPrecious things are without value to those who cannot prize them.", "The Lion, the Bear, and the Fox\nJust as a great Bear rushed to seize a stray kid, a Lion leaped from another direction upon the same prey. The two fought furiously for the prize until they had received so many wounds that both sank down unable to continue the battle.\nJust then a Fox dashed up, and seizing the kid, made off with it as fast as he could go, while the Lion and the Bear looked on in helpless rage.\n'How much better it would have been,' they said, 'to have shared in a friendly spirit.'\nThose who have all the toil do not always get the profit.", "The Dogs and the Fox\nSome Dogs found the skin of a Lion and furiously began to tear it with their teeth. A Fox chanced to see them and laughed scornfully.\n'If that Lion had been alive,' he said, 'it would have been a very different story. He would have made you feel how much sharper his claws are than your teeth.'\nIt is easy and also contemptible to kick a man that is down.", "The Bear and the Bees\nA Bear roaming the woods in search of berries happened on a fallen tree in which a swarm of Bees had stored their honey. The Bear began to nose around the log very carefully to find out if the Bees were at home. Just then one of the swarm came home from the clover field with a load of sweets. Guessing what the Bear was after, the Bee flew at him, stung him sharply and then disappeared into the hollow log.\nThe Bear lost his temper in an instant, and sprang upon the log tooth and claw, to destroy the nest. But this only brought out the whole swarm. The poor Bear had to take to his heels, and he was able to save himself only by diving into a pool of water.\nIt is wiser to bear a single injury in silence than to provoke a thousand by flying into a rage.", "The Mule\nA Mule had had a long rest and much good feeding. He was feeling very vigorous indeed, and pranced around loftily, holding his head high.\\n'My father certainly was a full-blooded racer,' he said. 'I can feel that distinctly.'\nNext day he was put into harness again and that evening he was very downhearted indeed.\n'I was mistaken,' he said. 'My father was a Donkey after all.'\nBe sure of your pedigree before you boast of it.", "The Sick Stag\nA Stag had fallen sick. He had just strength enough to gather some food and find a quiet clearing in the woods, where he lay down to wait until his strength should return. The Animals heard about the illness and came to ask after his health. Of course, they were all hungry, and helped themselves freely to the food of the Stag. And as you would expect, the Stag soon starved to death.\nGood will is worth nothing unless it is accompanied by good acts.", "The Fox and the Crab\nA Crab one day grew disgusted with the sands in which he lived. He decided to take a stroll to the meadow not far inland. There he would find better fare than briny water and sand mites. So off he crawled to the meadow. But there a hungry Fox spied him, and in a twinkling, ate him up, both shell and claw.\nBe content with your lot.", "The Wolves and the Sheep\nA pack of Wolves lurked near the Sheep pasture. But the Dogs kept them all at a respectful distance, and the Sheep grazed in perfect safety. But now the Wolves thought of a plan to trick the Sheep.\n'Why is there always this hostility between us?' they said. 'If it were not for those Dogs who are always stirring up trouble, I am sure we should get along beautifully. Send them away and you will see what good friends we shall become.'\nThe Sheep were easily fooled. They persuaded the Dogs to go away, and that very evening the Wolves had the grandest feast of their lives.\nDo not give up friends for foes.", "The Mole and his Mother\nA little Mole once said to his Mother:\n'Why, Mother, you said I was blind! But I am sure I can see!'\nMother Mole saw she would have to get such conceit out of his head. So she put a bit of frankincense before him and asked him to tell what it was.\nThe little Mole peered at it.\n'Why, that is a pebble!'\n'Well, my son, that proves you have lost your sense of smell as well as being blind.'\nBoast of one thing and you will be found lacking in that and a few other things as well.",  "Jupiter and the Monkey\nThere was once a baby show among the Animals in the forest. Jupiter provided the prize. Of course all the proud mammas from far and near brought their babies. But none got there earlier than Mother Monkey. Proudly she presented her baby among the other contestants.\nAs you can imagine, there was quite a laugh when the Animals saw the ugly flat-nosed, hairless, pop-eyed little creature.\n'Laugh if you will,' said the Mother Monkey. 'Though Jupiter may not give him the prize, I know that he is the prettiest, the sweetest, the dearest darling in the world.'\nMother love is blind.",  "The Swallow and the Crow\nThe Swallow and the Crow had an argument one day about their plumage.\nSaid the Swallow: 'Just look at my bright and downy feathers. Your black stiff quills are not worth having. Why do not you dress better? Show a little pride!'\n'Your feathers may do very well in spring,' replied the Crow, 'but—I do not remember ever having seen you around in winter, and that is when I enjoy myself most.'\nFriends in fine weather only, are not worth much.", "The Flies and the Honey\nA jar of honey was upset and the sticky sweetness flowed out on the table. The sweet smell of the honey soon brought a large number of Flies buzzing around. They did not wait for an invitation. No, indeed. They settled right down, feet and all, to gorge themselves. The Flies were quickly smeared from head to foot with honey. Their wings stuck together. They could not pull their feet out of the sticky mass. And so they died, giving their lives for the sake of a taste of sweetness.\nBe not greedy for a little passing pleasure. It may destroy you.", "The Porcupine and the Snakes\nA Porcupine was looking for a good home. At last he found a little sheltered cave, where lived a family of Snakes. He asked them to let him share the cave with them, and the Snakes kindly consented.\nThe Snakes soon wished they had not given him permission to stay. His sharp quills pricked them at every turn, and at last they politely asked him to leave.\n'I am very well satisfied, thank you,' said the Porcupine. 'I intend to stay right here.' And with that, he politely escorted the Snakes out of doors. And to save their skins, the Snakes had to look for another home.\nGive a finger and lose a hand.", "The Old Lion\nA Lion had grown very old. His teeth were worn away. His limbs could no longer bear him, and the King of Beasts was very pitiful indeed as he lay gasping on the ground, about to die.\nWhere now his strength and his former graceful beauty?\nNow a Boar spied him, and rushing at him, gored him with his yellow tusk. A Bull trampled him with his heavy hoofs. Even a contemptible Ass let fly his heels and brayed his insults in the face of the Lion.\nIt is cowardly to attack the defenseless, though he be an enemy.", "The Boy and the Nettle\nA Boy, stung by a Nettle, ran home crying, to get his mother to blow on the hurt and kiss it.\n'Son,' said the mother of the Boy, when she had comforted him, 'the next time you come near a Nettle, grasp it firmly, and it will be as soft as silk.'\nWhatever you do, do with all your might.", "The Quack Toad\nAn old Toad once informed all his neighbors that he was a learned doctor. In fact he could cure anything. The Fox heard the news and hurried to see the Toad. He looked the Toad over very carefully.\n'Mr. Toad,' he said, 'I have been told that you cure anything! But just take a look at yourself, and then try some of your own medicine. If you can cure yourself of that blotchy skin and that rheumatic gait, someone might believe you. Otherwise, I should advise you to try some other profession.'\nThose who would mend others, should first mend themselves.", "The Goatherd and the Goat\nA Goat strayed away from the flock, tempted by a patch of clover. The Goatherd tried to call it back, but in vain. It would not obey him. Then he picked up a stone and threw it, breaking the horn of the Goat.\nThe Goatherd was frightened.\n'Do not tell the master,' he begged the Goat.\n'No,' said the Goat, 'that broken horn can speak for itself!'\nWicked deeds will not stay hid."]
